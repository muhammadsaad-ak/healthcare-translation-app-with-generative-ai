## 2. AI Tools:

### **Translation API**: 
The app uses an AI-powered translation API for real-time text translation.
- **AI Technology**: Services like Google Cloud Translation, DeepL, or similar.
- **Usage**: Transcribed text is sent to the translation API based on the selected language, and translated text is returned.

### **Speech Synthesis API**:
Enables the playback of translated text using text-to-speech functionality.
- **AI Technology**: The browser's built-in `SpeechSynthesis` API.
- **Usage**: Converts the translated text to speech and plays it back using available language voices.

## 3. Security Considerations:

### **Authentication**:
- Use secure methods such as OAuth or JWT for user authentication.

### **Data Security**:
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement anti-CSRF tokens to prevent unauthorized requests.

### **API Security**:
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent excessive API requests.
- **API Key Management**: Secure API keys using environment variables (`.env.local`).
